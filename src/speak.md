Vermont Code Camp 2019 will need you! Please consider submitting a speaker session proposal. You don't have to be from Vermont to attend or speak. Help us with our ongoing work to build a more diverse conference experience by recommending appropriate speakers and/or organizers, and by sharing information about our call for proposals to relevant affinity groups. We welcome recommendations of future speakers and organizers.

Possible topics include .NET, PHP, Ruby, Python, Java&hellip;really, anything related to development.

Sessions are typically 30 minutes to 1 hour in duration, including time for questions. Feel free to submit one or several session proposals.
