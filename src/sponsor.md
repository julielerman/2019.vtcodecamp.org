Vermont Code Camp is free event for attendees and organized entirely by community volunteers, with the help of our sponsors. Our 2017 event drew 250 attendees. We had 7 session slots throughout the day with 5 sessions running at any one time. You can see last year’s schedule here.

WCAX visited during the day. Co-organizer, Rob Hale, was interviewed about the event.

While we keep our budget trim, we can’t pull off VT Code Camp without the financial support of our sponsors. Sponsorship opportunities typically include:

* **Feed us**: sponsor breakfast, lunch or afternoon snacks
* **Fund us**: enable us to cover our expenses for printing and other materials
* **Educate us**: send books, mags, training to raffle
* **Simplify our lives**: send your great software to raffle
* **Promote us**: give us advertising space
* **Entertain us**: sponsor the after party for speakers and volunteers
